        <h3 id="fix">Differential flatness, dynamic soaring and all that</h3>
        <p> 
        One of RAFT's current investigations include the development of a recipe which can allow
        a 6DoF aircraft model to be differentially flat. This formulation of flatness when applied to 
        conventional implementations that solve trajectory generation and tracking problems, improves
        the computational cost and reduces the information required for tracking a trajectory. 
        This technique has been applied to studies pertaining to fixed-wing dynamic soaring. 
        Flight manoevres where energy is extracted from wind-shear for countering the loss due to drag are 
        commonly termed as dynamic soaring. Investigations into these energy-neutral manoevres were
        inspired by the observation of Albatrosses flying untiringly over the oceans of the southern 
        latitudes. By enabling UAVs to engage in dynamic soaring, flight endurance can be greatly enhanced
        without any reliance on the on-board powerplant. <br>
        Analysing the stability of dynamic soaring orbits is another of RAFT's investigations in this 
        field. This enquiry is instrumental in the development of control strategies that can enable 
        UAVs to sustain a particular orbit in a realistic setting.

        <h3 id="fix">Aeromechanics and Flight Performance</h3>
        <p>
        Unlike the gracefully gliding, simple and elegant machines of flight that airplanes are, helicopters 
        are beasts that 'beat' the air into submission to achieve flight! A colossal amount of research and 
        labor goes into making these mechanised hummingbirds 'float like a butterfly and sting like a bee'.<br> 
        Aeromechanics comprise one of the fields that help these machines conquer the air. Although over the 
        years, rotorcraft have undeniably become safer and many complex phenomena have been resolved, there 
        still exist a few like dynamic stall in three-dimensions, rotor-wake interactions with external bodies 
        in motion, vortex-blade and vortex-vortex interactions that still remain hazy. To resolve the questions 
        that plague these phenomena and to ensure predictability, experiments and computational investigations 
        are performed using CFD or reduced order mathematical models. In many cases, the underlying 'simple' 
        physics might be made complex and indeterminable due to additional constraints or design elements. 
        Co-axial and compound helicopters are a prime example of this, where an extra rotor brings about considerable 
        variations in how the entire system behaves. In such cases, existing models require modification or new models proposed.<br>
        An active area of research on that note is finite state dynamic inflow modeling. Dynamic inflow models provide 
        information on the inflow across rotor disks and how they change over time. Presence of external obstacles also 
        influence such models and require extensive validation and testing like which is performed at RAFT. Vortex based 
        simulation methods are also actively explored since they offer many of the advantages of conventional CFD minus the huge computational 
        costs. These help in understanding how the rotor wake interacts with external obstacles or other rotors and how performance is affected.

        <h3 id="fix">Flight Dynamics and Control</h3>
        <p>
        Outwardly simple, the helicopter appears to the untrained eye to be a rotating rotor connected to a 
        non rotating fuselage with mechanical linkages. Strip it down, and you'll find that, that's a 
        deceivingly complex piece of engineering marvel. It would seem a surprise that this muddle of machinery 
        can fly, let alone be controlled! All this has only been made possible by in-depth analysis of the dynamics 
        and design of control mechanisms that have evolved over the years to state-of-the-art, fully 
        autonomous and fly-by-wire systems of today. However as the sphere of application increases, 
        the requirement to make the system more stable and robust also increases. At RAFT, we aim to 
        understand the dynamics, analyse the stability and develop robust control systems so as to 
        enable rotorcraft to soar higher and cruise faster.<br>
        Helicopters, like any other dynamic system are prone to instabilities and research over the years 
        have focused on understanding them, reasoning them out and developing preventive mechanisms for instabilities. 
        The focus of our research in flight dynamics has been on phenomena like ground resonance and 
        air resonance. Although we've come a long way since the Tacoma bridge incident that's popularly cited 
        in reference to resonance and resonance-induced instabilities, the mechanism behind ground and air 
        resonance in helicopters is slightly different. Ground resonance, has proven to be a pilot's nightmare 
        on many an occasion destroying the helicopter in a matter of seconds. The seemingly robust mechanical system, 
        built rigid enough to carry people and payload for years, breaks apart due to mere vibrations in the 
        blink of an eye. <br>
        Over the years, the frequency of incidents have reduced, thanks to helicopters 
        designed with efficient lead lag dampers and operating rpms chosen after extensive testing. However, 
        a considerable number of pilots still report incidents involving ground resonance in certain instances like ship deck landings 
        further establishing the need for deeper investigation of this phenomenon. Work at RAFT 
        is focused on analytical and experimental investigation of ground resonance, understanding the 
        influence of various mechanical and aerodynamic parameters and development of stability augmentation 
        systems and procedures for ground resonance prevention. In addition, simulations of helicopters 
        landing on ship decks are performed to understand how ground proximity and wake dynamics affect stability and handling qualities.

        <h3 id="fix">Flapping Flight</h3>
        <p>
        Man in his advance in technology ever since the stone ages have always been inspired from nature, 
        be it in harnessing the mighty power of fire, inventing the wheel or building homes. One of the most 
        fascinating inventions inspired from nature is flight. Over the past century, advances in technology 
        have ensured fast commute of millions of passengers and tons of cargo every year. While the flight of 
        birds inspired the Wright brothers, its smaller counterparts, insects, continue to inspire and intrigue 
        us to this day. Insects are one of the most abundant species in the planet, but they are also the least 
        understood by science. Part of this problem arises from their small size. and also from the extremely high flapping 
        frequencies of their wings.<br>
        The purpose of our research is to identify how these insects fly and how they achieve stability in their flight. 
        The beauty of insect flight is that they are highly efficient in order to make good use of the small amount of energy they can store. 
        This curiosity about the flight of insects is not merely an academic inquisitiveness but its knowledge shows great 
        promise in the field of Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs). Experts predict that insect-sized robots will be the future 
        in both military (e.g. Surveillance of a building occupied by terrorists) as well as civilian (e.g. Remote 
        inspection of air ducts in buildings) applications. RAFT believes in being a positive contributor towards this future.
