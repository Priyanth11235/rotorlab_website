        <h3 id="fix">Differential flatness, dynamic soaring and all that</h3>
        <p> 
        One of RAFT's current investigations include the development of a recipe which can allow
        a 6DoF aircraft model to be differentially flat. This formulation of flatness when applied to 
        conventional implementations that solve trajectory generation and tracking problems, improves
        the computational cost and reduces the information required for tracking a trajectory. 
        This technique has been applied to studies pertaining to fixed-wing dynamic soaring. 
        Flight manoevres where energy is extracted from wind-shear for countering the loss due to drag are 
        commonly termed as dynamic soaring. Investigations into these energy-neutral manoevres were
        inspired by the observation of Albatrosses flying untiringly over the oceans of the southern 
        latitudes. By enabling UAVs to engage in dynamic soaring, flight endurance can be greatly enhanced
        without any reliance on the on-board powerplant. <br>
        Analysing the stability of dynamic soaring orbits is another of RAFT's investigations in this 
        field. This enquiry is instrumental in the development of control strategies that can enable 
        UAVs to sustain a particular orbit in a realistic setting.

        <h3 id="fix">Aeromechanics and Flight Performance</h3>
        <p>
        Unlike the gracefully gliding, simple and elegant machines of flight that airplanes are, helicopters 
        are beasts that 'beat' the air into submission to achieve flight! A colossal amount of research and 
        labor goes into making these mechanised hummingbirds 'float like a butterfly and sting like a bee'.<br> 
        Aeromechanics comprise one of the fields that help these machines conquer the air. Although over the 
        years, rotorcraft have undeniably become safer and many complex phenomena have been resolved, there 
        still exist a few like dynamic stall in three-dimensions, rotor-wake interactions with external bodies 
        in motion, vortex-blade and vortex-vortex interactions that still remain hazy. To resolve the questions 
        that plague these phenomena and to ensure predictability, experiments and computational investigations 
        are performed using CFD or reduced order mathematical models. In many cases, the underlying 'simple' 
        physics might be made complex and indeterminable due to additional constraints or design elements. 
        Co-axial and compound helicopters are a prime example of this, where an extra rotor brings about considerable 
        variations in how the entire system behaves. In such cases, existing models require modification or new models proposed.<br>
        An active area of research on that note is finite state dynamic inflow modeling. Dynamic inflow models provide 
        information on the inflow across rotor disks and how they change over time. Presence of external obstacles also 
        influence such models and require extensive validation and testing like which is performed at RAFT. Vortex based 
        simulation methods are also actively explored since they offer many of the advantages of conventional CFD minus the huge computational 
        costs. These help in understanding how the rotor wake interacts with external obstacles or other rotors and how performance is affected.
