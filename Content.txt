Part of the Aerospace Engineering Department at IIT Madras, RAFT, focuses on research pertaining to rotary-wing aircraft and other innovative flight technologies.  We explore multiple avenues of aeromechanics which include experimental studies on rotor-based aircraft, numerical modeling of the aerodynamic environment around a rotor to predict rotor performance, studies on dynamic stall, and flapping wing flight to name a few. Flight dynamics is also pursued, involving investigations on ground and air resonance phenomena and their predictive methods, effects of dynamic stall on stability of helicopters, and trajectory tracking and optimisation. This challenging interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary aspect of rotorcraft research gathers together students and researchers here, all attempting to unravel the mysteries of flight, one tangle at a time. Ceaselessly persistent, never yielding.
