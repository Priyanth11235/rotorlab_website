Part of the Aerospace Engineering Department at IIT Madras, RAFT, focuses on research pertaining to rotary-wing aircraft and other innovative flight technologies.  We explore multiple avenues of aeromechanics which include experimental studies on rotor-based aircraft, numerical modeling of the aerodynamic environment around a rotor to predict rotor performance, studies on dynamic stall, and flapping wing flight to name a few. Flight dynamics is also pursued, involving investigations on ground and air resonance phenomena and their predictive methods, effects of dynamic stall on stability of helicopters, and trajectory tracking and optimisation. This challenging interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary aspect of rotorcraft research gathers together students and researchers here, all attempting to unravel the mysteries of flight, one tangle at a time. Ceaselessly persistent, never yielding.

Aeromechanics and Performance

    Unlike the gracefully gliding, simple and elegant machines of flight that airplanes are, helicopters are beasts that beat the air into submission to achieve flight! A colossal amount of research and labor goes into making these mechanised hummingbirds 'float like a butterfly and sting like a bee'. 

    Aeromechanics comprise one of the fields that help these machines conquer the air. Although over the years, rotorcraft have undeniably become safer and many complex phenomena have been resolved, there still exist a few like dynamic stall in three-dimensions, rotor-wake interactions with external bodies in motion, vortex-blade and vortex-vortex interactions that still remain hazy. To resolve the questions that plague these phenomena and to ensure predictability, experiments and computational investigations are performed using CFD or reduced order mathematical models. In many cases, the underlying 'simple' physics might be made complex and indeterminable due to additional constraints or design elements. Co-axial and compound helicopters are a prime example of this, where an extra rotor brings about considerable variations in how the entire system behaves. In such cases, existing models require modification or new models proposed. An active area of research on that note is finite state dynamic inflow modeling. Dynamic inflow models provide information on the inflow across rotor disks and how they change over time. Presence of external obstacles also influence such models and require extensive validation and testing like which is performed at RAFT. Vortex based smulation methods are also actively explored since they offer many of the advantages of CFD minus the computational costs. These help in understanding how the rotor wake interacts with external obstacles or other rotors and in turn affect rotor performance.
