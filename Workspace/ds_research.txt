One of RAFT's current investigations include the development of a recipe which can allow
a 6DoF aircraft model to be differentially flat. This formulation of flatness when applied to 
conventional implementations that solve trajectory generation and tracking problems, improves
the computational cost and reduces the information required for tracking a trajectory. 
This technique has been applied to studies pertaining to fixed-wing dynamic soaring. 
Flight manoevres where energy is extracted from wind-shear for countering the loss due drag are 
commonly termed as dynamic soaring. Investigations into these energy-neutral manoevres were
inspired by the observation of Albatrosses flying untiringly over the oceans of the southern 
latitudes. By enabling UAVs to engage in dynamic soaring, flight endurance can be greatly enhanced
without any reliance on the on-board powerplant. 
Analysing the stability of dynamic soaring orbits is another of RAFT's investigations in this 
field. This enquiry is instrumental in the development of control strategies that can enable 
UAVs to sustain a particular orbit in a realistic setting.
